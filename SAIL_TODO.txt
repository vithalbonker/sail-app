How to refresh the browser page when code is changed during development?

Tree Structure
    JSON content of root folder:
    -----------------------------
      [{ "id" : "root", "parent" : "#", "text" : "Root", "icon":"/public/images/folder-16-16.png" }]

    Known Issues
    -------------
       1) If user is trying to create folder/script with the same one as existing ones then error is not shown. Need to handle these scenarios.
       2) Increase/decrease the width of the tree is not implemented
       3) Cut & Copy operations are not implemented. But drag & drop functionality is available.
       4) When mouse hover is done, tree data should be posted - This is already fixed but need to test it.
       5) Error messages in client console when alert/prompt is displayed
